Introduction

On daily basis, more networks and gadgets are connected to the internet, The web has become 
indispensable as it hosts productivity software suites for creating documents, spreadsheets
and email. Applications suites for calculator, live television streaming, and weather which 
are daily needs are also hosted on the web. [1]

Web applications provide online banking services, services for storing pictures and documents
in the cloud, services that connects home devices such IP camera to mobile phone for remote 
monitoring and ecommerce services. Sensitive data like password, credit card details are usually 
required to access these web services.

These web applications that provide web services listed in the two paragraphs above, unfortunately
could have some vulnerabilities which attackers can exploit. Despite network defenses like firewall
and intrusion prevention systems. [1]

In IT/TCP network protocol the application layer is the most accessed, exposed and difficult to defend.
In addition, vulnerabilities experienced in the application layer are because of complicated user input 
activities that is difficult to categorized with intrusion detection signature. [1]

In the recent past, attackers have used methods such as Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards, Cross-Site Request, 
Heartbeat and Shellshock, Security Misconfiguration and Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerabilities to manipulate their
victims’ applications and accessed victims’ personal information. [1]

Capability-based security is a type of a system security in which processes running in a system have some authority 
or set of authorities by default or explicit user’s action to protect users’ data. Since applications may have 
vulnerabilities and application users can be tricked to run malicious programs by attackers. [2,26]

To reduce the harmful effects of malicious applications, the authority applications have over resources
must be limited to the minimum authority required for their computation. There are two ways to store and
manage the authority processes’(applications’) have over resources (data) by computer system. One is Access
Control List (ACL), the other is Capability List (CL). [2,27]

In Access Control List (ACL), there is a column of matrix in each resource which contains pairs of process and authority.
The Capability List (CL), contains elements known as capabilities which are references to resources and the authorities
to use these resources.
